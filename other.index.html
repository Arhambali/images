    <p>The Himalayas, spanning across Asia, are home to Mount Everest, the world's highest peak.
         Formed by tectonic plate collisions, they are geologically active and provide water to 
         millions through rivers like the Ganges and Indus. Rich in biodiversity, they house species
          like snow leopards and red pandas. The Himalayas also influence climate, regulate monsoons,
           and hold cultural and spiritual significance.

Rivers are vital for ecosystems, providing water for drinking, agriculture, and industry. They support diverse plant and animal life and play a crucial role in shaping landscapes through erosion and deposition. Famous rivers like the Nile, Amazon, and Ganges are lifelines for millions, offering resources, transportation, and cultural significance.

    A forest is a large area covered with trees, shrubs, and other vegetation, serving as a critical habitat for countless species. Forests play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by producing oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, and regulating the climate.

    They provide resources like timber, medicine, and food while supporting millions of people and animals. Forests are also essential for preventing soil erosion, maintaining water cycles, and offering a natural space for recreation and inspiration.
